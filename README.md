# Trip Builder API using the Lumen PHP Framework

The Trip Builder API is a simple API to see airports, see each flights departing from an airport and construct trips based of the possible flight paths provided.

Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.
